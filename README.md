# voomio Contract

## Assets

The Plutus Core and script addresses for testnet and mainnet are checked in the `assets` folder.

- `assets/swap.plutus`
- `assets/testnet/swap.addr`
- `assets/mainnet/swap.addr`

## Specification

A seller can list one or more assets in a lock transaction.

A buyer can buy one or more assets and accept one or more offers in the same transaction.
An offer can be accepted for an asset that is listed or an asset in the seller's wallet.

Seller "offer" or "sell" datum contains:
* owner pkh
* assets being sold
* payouts

Payouts structure contains:
array (
      {*payout address,*payout amount},...
)

buyer submits "accept" for one or more "offer"s:
* includes the utxos and "offer" datums for each thing on offer along with "accept" redeemers that contains no additional info
* validation:
  * assume that all other redeemers are "accept" redeemers
    * expectation is that if one of the other redeemers is a different redeemer, either the validation of the "accept" redeemer or the validation of the other redeemers will fail
  * gathers all the datums as "offer" datums
    * assets from the "offer" datums are paid out to addresses chosen by buyer
    * sums up the payouts from the "offer" datums and make sure they are being paid out correctly

seller can "cancel" in bulk things they own
* includes the utxos and "offer" and "sell" datums for each thing listed along with "cancel" redeemers that contains no additional info
* validation:
  * assume that all other redeemers are "cancel" redeemers
    * expectation is that if one of the other redeemers is a different redeemer, either the validation of the "cancel" redeemer or the validation of the other redeemers will fail
  * gathers all the datums as "offer" datums
    * checks that the signer (there should be only one) is the owner of each

implications of the above:

* a "accept" *could* occur in the same tx as a "cancel"
  * the owner of the "offer" being cancelled is the buyer of another "offer"
  * could they exploit the SC in some way?
    * TBD

* multiple different redeemers appearing in the same tx for the same "offer" datum will fail the tx, with some exceptions
  * "accept" and "cancel" would expect the asset to go to different addresses
    * unless the seller and buyer are the same

## Creating the Script Address

After compiling the smart contract, it is necessary to make a script address.

Next, run:

```bash
scripts/compile.sh
```

To include debug tracing in the contract add `#define DEBUG` to the top of DebugUtilities.h
Then run clean and compile.

## Example Transactions

The `integration-tests/Main.hs` file has example transactions of various kinds.

## Running the Tests

Before running the tests you need to set up environment variables.

```bash
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=<your node path>
```

Set `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` to the path of the appropriate Daedalus socket file (either Testnet Daedalus or the regular mainnet Daedalus). It you run a `cardano-node` on your own you should set this environment variable to your socket file location.

```bash
export WALLET_DIR=<dir with wallet skey and vkey files>
```

Set `WALLET_DIR` to a directory which contains the signing key files and verification key files of the wallets for `seller1`, `seller2`, `buyer`, `marketplace`, and `royalities` wallets. If the file `$WALLET_DIR/<name>.vkey` does not exist, a new wallet will be created and 100 ada transferred to it. If the `WALLET_DIR` is not set, a temporary directory will be used.

```bash
export SOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS_PATH=<path to user addr file>
export SOURCE_WALLET_SKEY_PATH=<path to user skey file>
```

Set `SOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS_PATH` and `SOURCE_WALLET_SKEY_PATH` to the files containing the wallet address and signing key that will be used as a source of funds for any newly created wallets. These are required, but if the `WALLET_DIR` is set and all the wallets already exist, they will not be used.

```bash
export TESTNET_MAGIC=1097911063
```

Set `TESTNET_MAGIC` if you are using a testnet. Otherwise, mainnet will be assumed.

### Environment Variable Files

To make setting the environment variables easier, there are three environment variable files you can source.

However, the paths to the `cardano-node` socket might need to be modified to work on your system.

The three files are:
- `scripts/envars/local-testnet.envs`
- `scripts/envars/testnet.envs`
- `scripts/envars/mainnet.envs`

To source them run:

```bash
source scripts/envars/testnet.envs
```

### Actually Running the Tests

To run the tests run

```bash
cabal test
```
